## Introduction

This project aims to create a website where the Points of interest are Treks and trails which are categorised in to Mountains, Hill, Woodland/Parkland & Greenways.
Wihtin each category there will be a define list of know spots and the user can add treks that do not exist on the site.

### Prerequisites
TDD,
This is the TDD method in action:

- Write a test
- Test fails
- Do enough to make the test pass
- Reflect on the implementation, perhaps simplify/refactor, and re-run the test
- Test passes again (API, DB)
